            <h2>Closing Non-conformities and reporting Services</h2>
            <p>
              Non-conformance (NC) refers to any deviation from the specified
              requirements, standards, or procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a non-conformance is identified within an organization, it is
              crucial to document and report it through a structured
              non-conformance reporting (NCR) process. This involves capturing
              relevant information about the nonconformance, such as the nature
              of the deviation, its impact, and any associated corrective
              actions or preventive measures taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              API non-conformance reporting aims to facilitate effective
              management of nonconformities, ensuring that appropriate actions
              are taken to address and rectify the identified issues. This
              process promotes quality control, continual improvement, and
              compliance with API standards, ultimately contributing to the
              overall integrity and safety of operations within the oil and gas
              industry.

                  <strong>A Major Non-Conformance:</strong>
                  <span>
                    major non-conformance is a significant deviation or failure
                    to comply with the audit criteria or requirements, having a
                    profound impact on the effectiveness, safety, quality, or
                    compliance of the audited system, process, or product. These
                    non-conformances often involve critical lapses, systemic
                    failures, non-compliance with regulatory requirements, or
                    high-risk issues that could potentially compromise safety or
                    quality. Prompt identification and corrective action are
                    essential to address major non-conformances and mitigate
                    their impact, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the
                    audited system or process.</span

                  <strong>Minor Non-Conformance:</strong>
                  <span>
                    A minor non-conformance refers to a less significant
                    deviation or non-compliance with the audit criteria or
                    requirements, resulting in a limited impact on the overall
                    effectiveness, safety, quality, or compliance of the audited
                    system, process, or product. These non-conformances
                    typically involve isolated incidents, minor documentation
                    issues, non-compliance with non-critical procedural
                    requirements, or deviations that have minimal impact on the
                    final product quality. While that are considered less
                    severe, it is important to address and rectify minor
                    non-conformances to ensure continuous improvement and
                    adherence to standards.</span
